# Projet Ventura

Integration of MacOS on the web.

This code design the main parts of MacOSX including the lock screen, the finder as well as the launchpad and a minimum of applications.

The project was designed to contain my portfolio, solve new challenges, but also to attract future recruiters.

Written in HTML5, CSS3, ES6 (JavaScript 2015+) and jQuery, this jewel is regularly maintained for the good use of users. I plan to integrate components such as Vue.js to get familiar with the library.
